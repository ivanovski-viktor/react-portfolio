              <p>
                Hey, I'm Viktor Ivanovski, a coder from Skopje. I've been
                interested in the world of IT since the young age of 9. Starting
                with operating systems and computer hardware, I later made the
                switch to software development in 2019. Since then, I've been
                steadily working towards a career in web development. When I'm
                not coding, you'll find me exploring the digital realm, taking
                breaks with some gaming and a few chapters of manga. I like to
                keep things balanced, throwing in the occasional coding binge,
                and, of course, savoring a drink or two. Cheers! üòÅ
